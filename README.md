# Autonomous Robot for Agriculture Applications
Project to perform autonomous navigation of rover robots in farm fields at early stages

-Simulation of farm field for sintetic data generation
A group of Semantic Segmentations tools for generation of sintetic data for:
  - Input for data set (Semantic Segmentation) Blender files
  - Low definition input data for simulation on Gazebo(ROS)

-Map Compiller

Proyect to create a usefull map for robot localization given a set of raw images.
